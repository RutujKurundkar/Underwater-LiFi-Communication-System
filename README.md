# Underwater Li-Fi Communication System

## 🌊 Project Overview
This project demonstrates a wireless data transmission system designed for submerged environments using **Li-Fi (Light Fidelity)** technology. It uses visible light to send data, providing a high-speed and interference-resistant alternative to traditional acoustic or RF communication.

## 📂 Project Structure
*   📁 **[code/](./code/)**: Contains the Arduino source files for both the transmitter and receiver.
*   📁 **[images/](./images/)**: Includes the system flowchart, circuit diagrams, and setup photos.
*   📁 **[report/](./report/)**: Holds the comprehensive project report and technical documentation.

## 🚀 Key Features
*   **High-Speed Transmission**: Faster data rates than traditional acoustic methods.
*   **Low Latency**: Real-time communication suitable for underwater robotics.
*   **Cost-Effective**: Built using accessible components like LEDs and Photodiodes.
